0) everything & all
	- separate classes for ortographic and perspective projections
	- texture size of viewport, for now it's fixed change to scale to size
	- shader program manager or shader cache
	- reversing quaternion rotation to zero changes object orientation because of commutativity	
	- set action hierarchy
	- set name for process to parse in assimp wrapper
	- check fps and delta time

1) animation 
	- when setting data in slider through click action doesn't trigger update matrix of children
	- load and animate fbx and animation files
	- show vertex weights in shader

2) Scene graph
	- set scene graph in its own window at the top right corner
	- set data in Node to be template instead of void*

3) Shaders
	- shader program manager or shader cache
	- viewport grid needs to be fading in distance
	- point light is following the camera


	take bones from mesh bones list and check if the name matches in node hierarchy and set those nodes as bones node the list ones
	bones shouldn't be under character anim

	can be found
	1) in node herarchy // just describes hierarchy of the bones
	2) in the array of the mesh



	PLAN 
	use different shader for vertex weight
	todo pogledaj u  blenderu bones i na koliko vertexa utice



	PLAN OF ATTACK
	load necessary data
	create scene graph with previously aquired data or for efficiency sake aquire data while creating scene graph
	mozda dodaj svaku funkciju za node add tipa addMaterialNode, addMeshNode, addBoneNode
